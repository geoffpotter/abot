This agent specializes in writing code. It leverages advanced language models to generate code snippets based on the provided specifications. The agent can understand a variety of programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile tool for developers.

```python
class CodeWriterAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Code Writer Agent"
    
    def generate_code(self, language, specifications):
        # This method would use a language model to generate code based on the specifications.
        # For demonstration purposes, this is a placeholder implementation.
        return f"Generated {language} code based on specifications: {specifications}"
```

Thought: With the new agent file created, I should now add this agent to the project's documentation and list of agents to ensure it's recognized as part of the system. However, this task was specifically about adding another agent in the agents folder, which has been accomplished.
